# JavaScript Conditionals
#### Practice with conditionals in JavaScript.


### Instructions to Follow:
* Create a blank, valid HTML5 document.
* Create a JavaScript file
* Prompt the user to enter their phone number with dashes (XXX-XXX-XXX)
* Alert the user if their phone number is valid (True or False) according to the simple rule that the fourth and eighth characters must be dashes.
* Following the same procedure, prompt and validate the following fields:
  * birth date (xx/xx/xx)
  * postal code (xxxxx OR xxxxx-xxxx)
  * state abbreviation (XX)
  * married ("yes" or "no" or "YES" or "NO" or "Yes" or "No")

A quick note: My comments for my work are in the code. I did not add any of the comments for this project in CodePen.
